# Collatz conjecture demonstration

Take a number, any number.\
If it’s even, halve it.\
If it’s odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.\
Repeat.\
Do all starting numbers lead to 1?

## Colltaz conjecture says they are!

You can try it yourself with the site I created.\
Just enter any integer and the app will calculate you the Collatz row following the rules above.
